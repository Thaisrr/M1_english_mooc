                "<p>For our starter we are going to make raviolis stuffed with ceps and a vegetable and truffle broth. This recipe is divided in two steps. First step, we are going to make the pasta dough, and for the second step, we will make the stuffing for the raviolis.\n</p>" +
                "<p>For the whole recipe we need 200g of all purpose flour, three eggs, one burrata, a little bit of olive oil, 300g of frozen ceps. You can also use dried ceps, both are good. A teaspoon of truffle paste, you can use fresh truffles, but it is more expensive. One onion, two little carrots, or a big one. A bunch of parsley, one scallion, one celery stick. And for the broth we need a piece of leek, a branch of thyme and some leaves of laurel.\n</p>" +
                "<p>So, let's start with the pasta dough. We will need the flour and the three eggs. Start by sieving the flour on the workbench, it will prevent our dough to have to many lumps. Make a little well in the center of the flour. Break two eggs into the well and one yolk. A little bit of salt. Start mixing the eggs and the flour with a fork. This step is mainly to prevent the eggs from spreading on your workbench. You can do it in a large bowl, but it is easier on a workbench. Try not to waste as much flour as you can and continue mixing until your dough is very very smooth with no lumps. The dough needs to be soft, a little bit elastic but not sticky. At the end, the dough must be consistent. When your eggs and the flour are approximately mixed, you can knead it like a bread dough. It will take about ten minutes for the dough to be ready to rest. So, now that our dough has been kneaded for about ten minutes, you can see that the dough is very smooth. Not sticky at all. When you pinch it, it keeps its shape, without holes. Now the dough needs to rest about one hour in the fridge.\n</p>" +
                "<p>Now, let’s start the second part of the recipe by making a vegetable broth. For that we need the onion, the two carrots and the celery stick. First roughly chop the onion into pieces. The pieces do not need to be very small, it’s just to add some flavor to the broth. Put it on the side of your board. Peel the carrots. Cut the tips and like for the onion roughly chop the carrots. Same for the celery stick, cut it into smaller sticks. And now let’s go to the stove to cook the broth.\n</p>" +
                "<p>So now that our vegetables are ready let’s make the broth. Put a large saucepan on medium heat with olive oil into it. Wait a little, depending on your stove, for the pan to warm up. Now that the pan is hot, put the vegetables into it. Let the veggies gently cook without burning them nor letting the vegetables taking a color in order to keep their original one. When you pan is hot and steaming, you can add to the broth the liquid that you got from the de-freezed mushrooms. Add one liter of water, the piece of leek, the thyme, and the laurel. Put some salt into it, not too much, you can always add it at the end. And some truffle paste. One (or two) teaspoon is enough.\n</p>" +
                "<p>Now that our broth is cooking, take your ceps and chop them into small pieces. It needs to be small because we will stuff the raviolis with the ceps, and we don’t want to have too big pieces. As you can there is a lot of water, that is because with have used frozen ceps. If you can use fresh ceps, it is a lot better. Now that our ceps are chopped, we will cook them in a frying pan, before using it to stuff the raviolis.\n</p>" +
                "<p>Take your frying pan, put it on the stove on high heat. We want to fry the ceps a little bit. Put some olive oil in the pan. Not too much. Add some pepper and salt. Now that our ceps are cooked, we will finish the stuffing by chopping some parsley. So, take your bunch of parsley. Take off the leaves, we do not want to put the branches in the stuffing. Take a large knife. It is always easier to chop vegetables or herbs with a large knife. We start by making sort of a ball with the parsley and roughly chopping it. Then, put the tip of the knife on the board, put your hand in the tip and hold your knife near to the guard. Start chopping. Take a large bowl. Put your ceps into it. Then add the parsley. Take the burrata and open it with the knife (careful with your fingers). Then add the cream (the inside part of the burrata) to the stuffing. Keep the rest of the burrata on the side and mix all the stuffing. And the stuffing is ready.\n</p>" +
                "<p>Now that our dough has rested for at least one hour. Take the dough out of the fridge. For this recipe we will use a pasta sheeter, but you can use also use a pastry pin. Put some flour on the dough and the workbench. Flatten the dough like a bread stick. It will be easier with the pasta sheeter. We start with the pasta sheeter set on 0 and we will lower the size little by little. Actually, the dough is too cold (take it out of the fridge 30 minutes before making the pasta), it is a little bit difficult to flatten it with the mill. Do it enough times to have a regular flattened dough. Now we will set the size on 1 and then flatten it again. Then set on 2. I think we will go up to 4 or 5, we will see. We want very thin raviolis so it will be nice to eat. We are now set on 3. Then 4 and 5. It should be ok at 5. I think we will try 6 to have very nice and thin raviolis. Ok, it is thin enough. You can see that the dough is very regular. Let’s flour it a little to prevent the dough from sticking while we fold it and stuff the raviolis. Not too much. And the pasta dough is ready.\n</p>" +
                "<p>So now that our dough is flattened in two very thin sheets, we will stuff it with the stuffing. Actually, you can see on the dough that I have made some circles to help me to put the stuffing right in the center. Do not put too much stuffing in the raviolis because it will be difficult to wrap it. Now that our raviolis have stuffing on them, let’s cut them with a cookie cutter. You can see that we have kept some room on the side of the raviolis to put some water and stick the two parts of the dough. So, take some water and use a brush to spread some on the sides of the raviolis, around the stuffing. Put the other part of the dough on each piece of ravioli. Just press all around the ravioli to enclose the stuffing inside it. Do not hesitate to press a little bit hard because we don’t want the stuffing to go outside the raviolis while they are cooling. \n</p>" +
                "<p>Missing part of the video: cook the raviolis for 3 minutes into the broth.\n</p>" +
                "<p>So now that our raviolis are cooked, we will make the dressage. Because it is a starter, we don’t want too many raviolis. Only three per person should be enough. So put three raviolis int the plate. Pour some broth into it. Add some chopped scallions and a little bit of burrata in the center. And voila!\n</p>",
